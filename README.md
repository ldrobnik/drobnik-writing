# Łukasz Drobnik’s Author Website

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A new version of my author website I’m building with **React**. Here is the [live demo](https://drobnik-writing-new.netlify.com/) of what I’ve done so far. You can also take a look at  [the previous version](https://github.com/ldrobnik/drobnik.co) made in Angular.

## Main features:
* fully **bilingual** site – language change with a single click
* **showcase of literary works** dynamically loaded from a constant
* dynamically rendered **interactive list of publications**
* **coloured** themes displayed depending on the current page
* optional **black-and-white mode** for better readability

## Technologies I’ve used so far:

* **React.js**
* **React-Router**
* **Redux**
* **styled-components**

## Technologies I’m planning to use:
* **react-transition-group**
