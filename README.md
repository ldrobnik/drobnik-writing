# Łukasz Drobnik’s Author Website

A new version of my author website I’m building with **React**. It is practically finished — I’m adding final touches and proofreading the copy. Here is the [live demo](https://drobnik-writing-new.netlify.com/). You can also take a look at [the previous version](https://github.com/ldrobnik/drobnik.co) made with Angular.

## Main features:
* a fully **bilingual** site – language change with a single click
* a **showcase of literary works** dynamically loaded from a constant
* a dynamically rendered **interactive list of publications**
* **coloured** themes displayed depending on the current page
* an optional **black-and-white mode** for better readability

## Technologies used:

* **React.js**
* **React-Router**
* **Redux**
* **Styled Components**
* **Pose**
* **FontAwesome**
* **React Waypoint**
* **react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll**
