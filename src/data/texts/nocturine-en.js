        <p> Blood vessels were dilating, pulmonary alveoli evenly filled with air and then emptied, I was running along a tramline, the sky was still clear. While running I could see the Merchant of Poznań department store, there were people, I could hear keys and coins jingling in my pocket.</p>
        <p>I was in a hurry to get home. The city, I thought, had been much nicer since they’d built the new tramline, I wanted to get home before Kazik left, because he was about to leave, there were white clouds in the sky, the sky was blue, there was even some sun, Kazik was about to go to another city for a while.</p>
        <p>The Chopin Park, the pink church, I was running along the tracks, the sky was clear, in places I could see black, perfectly symmetrical cubes, at different heights, yet still much higher than tenement roofs. I thought. I remember, that it was an ad campaign for a new mobile phone company — <i>that</i> was supposed to justify there appearing black levitating cubes all over the city, an appearance that aroused dismay, surprise, anxiety or whatever other feeling those cubes were meant to arouse, and after two weeks it was going to become clear it was all just meant to make you buy a new phone, from a new company, with a new camera and an mp3 player.</p>
        <p>I wanted to make it to see Kazik, but first I had to give Mirka back a book I’d borrowed from her before she left as well, white clouds, squares against the background of white clouds, they seemed so two-dimensional from the ground, they were cubes though. Before she left, because Mirka was about to leave as well, soon, I had no idea if I was going to see her again or if she was really going to leave, because there’d been a few times when she’d been supposed to leave but eventually hadn’t, I thought there was fog, even though the air was clear and the sky was blue.</p>
        <p>There was no fog, that was just my thinking, but if there’d been any it would have tightly covered all the buildings: tenement houses, shops, and one couldn’t see a thing, and I would have just been running in that whiteness, and that whiteness would have been cold.</p>
        <p>I was 15 minutes late, it could be worse, Mirka had been waiting for me somewhere in Garbary Street, I don’t know why we’d arranged to meet there exactly, maybe she liked to watch the wig shop, or perhaps there was some more important reason. As I was running, I could see the cubes sometimes. I was much more interested however in what was in front of me and under my feet so that I wouldn’t trip over the bloody uneven paving.</p>
        <p>I saw Mirka from a distance, she was kind enough not to look ostentatiously at her watch, the tenement roofs were above us, there was the sky, the cubes in the sky, and I ran up to her, panting, my eyes said I’m sorry but she just smiled and kissed me on the cheek, commenting on the stubble I hadn’t had time to shave and we went somewhere, don’t remember where.</p>
        <p>I remember it was some shitty café and that on its walls there were some awkwardly painted figures of actors, I’m starting to recall what café it was, from time to time Mirka ran her fingers through her bright hair, she was wearing it loose where usually she wore it tied up, and her eyes that day were somewhat sad.</p>
        <p>I gave her the book, and she said she wasn’t going to leave yet, said she’d stay a little longer in this fucking city, in this fucking country, and I thought that at that very moment the fog filled the whole café and everyone was enveloped in it and the waitress was groping her way around or maybe she had a special fog suit and fog lights. Mirka kept running her fingers through her hair.</p>
        <p>I said I was in a hurry, said I wanted to make it before Kazik left, so I could stay only for an hour or so, I had already forgotten when his train was leaving.</p>
        <p>Mirka kept talking through that fog, though there was no fog, and I listened to her but at the same time thought about 8-bit games like <i>Boulder Dash</i>, I loved to play those 8-bit games on 8-bit computers when I was a kid and spent hours in my yellow room upstairs using a screwdriver to adjust the head in the tape drive and on the screen there appeared sprites that were 24 pixels wide and 21 pixels high.</p>
        <p>Mirka was sad, I wasn’t surprised she felt that way, and though I really didn’t want her to leave I knew she would be better off somewhere else after all that had happened to her, because a couple of years earlier Mirka had suffered a coma and then her boyfriend, Przemek, had vanished somewhere but instead of talking about those sad things that sat still somewhere in her head she talked about Björk’s new album, that she really liked the song “Wanderlust”, I liked it as well and told her how I liked those horns, trumpets and whatever brass also played there, the beat I suspected was a beat from an early nineties drum machine. At the same time I thought about the cubes, I’d even dreamt about them, but then I still thought it was all an ad campaign.</p>
        <p>In those dreams the cubes were growing, they were like the amoeba from <i>Boulder Dash</i>  because in <i>Boulder Dash</i>  there was an amoeba that kept growing and growing and was composed of many square, pulsating elements and in those dreams the cubes were growing just like that amoeba but in 3D and new cubes kept appearing side by side, over and over again, although at that time all the cubes in the sky were still single.</p>
        <p>And I didn’t believe it could be any other way because for me they were still an ad campaign, just like when those big red hands had appeared all over the city. Mirka had thin wrists and pale palms, she was playing with a napkin, or maybe a beer mat, and said she’d found a new job and maybe wouldn’t leave this time — that is, it wasn’t for certain, just an offer, I thought about fog that entered the ears, entered the mouth and permeated every canal inside the body.</p>
        <p>And I thought about nucleotides that quite probably at that moment formed pairs in many different parts of my body and, quite probably, various mutations occurring, and every such mutation could lead to malignant neoplasm, and all I could do was count on each cell’s defence mechanism. I told Mirka it had been weird between me and Kazik lately, that we hadn’t been having sex at all because he’d been working all the time and I’d been staying at home so unemployed and playing on a Commodore 64 emulator and sending CVs and checking my email to see if anyone’d replied.</p>
        <p>Mirka told me to wait, to take it easy, to remember Kazik was a little reserved and that the whole situation probably blew his mind a little though he wouldn’t let anyone notice, she told me everything would be just fine and then started talking about some new shoes she’d spotted in a window but couldn’t afford.</p>
        <p>And then she said something about <i>Naked Lunch</i>, I’d read that book, but when I read it my mind kept drifting away, because it was when I suspected Kazik was having an affair, even though he probably wasn’t, only neurotransmitters inside my brain failing to work the way they should, so I don’t remember much from the book, later on Mirka said something about a guy she’d met but after all she’d been through she somehow wasn’t that keen on being with anyone or maybe just couldn’t.</p>
        <p>The book I gave her back was <i>Axing</i> by Stachura, actually I’d read only small fragments of it, because lately, somehow, I hadn’t the patience to read books, there were many brilliant fragments in that book including one about fog.</p>
        <p>We sat there for a while, and then I had to go, I paid the bill even though Mirka insisted on paying and we walked out, said goodbye, I embraced her tightly, we arranged to meet another day, I was happy she wasn’t leaving yet.</p>
        <p>I hummed inside my head, rushing to catch a tram.</p>
