<p>On days like this, Poznań was the cruellest of cities. It wasn’t easy to tell whether this was because of the twelve degrees of frost, the sharp sunlight, the motionless ice-bound white river, the snow lying on the roofs or a peculiar combination of these elements, but one could clearly sense that the city was streaked with a strange kind of anxiety, that its foundations were filled with elusive energy. You could swear it was about to suddenly break in half, and its northern and southern parts intended (just like jaws) to break away from the ground, rise towards each other with a violent movement and forcefully collide until Piątkowo’s blocks of flats (like teeth) fitted between the tenements of Wilda.</p>
<p className="centered">*</p>
<p>If you made, right along one of its walls, a longitudinal section through the pub Kisielice, on the left side of the colourful rectangle you would see a bar, the back of a bartender working behind the bar, a wall painted in vividly coloured stripes in the background, black-and-white artworks on the wall, and further towards the right end of the section: empty tables, chairs, sofas. The only clients in the pub visible from this perspective were a man and a woman, in their late twenties by the looks of it, who sat on a soft couch by the right edge of the rectangular section and talked, smoking tremendous amounts of cigarettes.</p>
<p>A cloud of grey smoke hung in the air, the woman talked about the seemingly never-ending winter, there hasn’t been a winter like this in years, about chronic lack of sleep, she looked at a window covered with a soaked poster depicting a deer and ran her fingers through her short, bright hair. When she spoke, she gesticulated wildly; while sitting, she constantly shifted; and when she was telling her companion about the preview she’d been to in that gallery in Jeżyce district, about the stunning works she’d seen there, she almost rose from the sofa.</p>
<p>The man, on the other hand, mostly sat in silence, inhaling smoke, listening to his friend, smiling faintly, but when he spoke, he covered his mouth with a hand closed into a fist or massaged his thick, dark eyebrow with a thumb and stared into the distance, which made him look unsure of what he was saying.</p>
<p>The pub was slowly filling up. Each time the door to the street opened, a piercing chill came in, covering in a flash the length of the stairs leading to the basement and permeating through a thick curtain which separated the pub’s vestibule from the long, colourful room. The man called the woman Weronika, while she addressed him as Wu. With the back of her hand, she stroked his few-day-old dark stubble and said it would be nice if Wu’d move his shapely arse again and go to the bar for a beer. Or not, maybe she’ll drink some wine, but only white, or better: white wine with sparkling water. And ice.</p>
<p>Wu smiled, put out his cigarette, kissed Weronika on the forehead and rose from the table. She followed him with her eyes as he stepped deeper into the pub, and then kept looking with yearning at his almost two-metre-high body leaning against the counter while he chatted with the bartender he apparently knew.</p>
<p>When he came back, she was sitting on the couch, snuggled into its corner, shrouded in a greenish glow beaming from her phone, texting someone obstinately. Once she noticed Wu, she took her legs off the seat and, leaning over the phone and pressing the buttons for a while longer. Wu asked whether it was Jerzy, and Weronika replied yes, that she was sorry and — after some hesitation — that it seemed Jerzy and she’d got together again.</p>
<p>In response to her friend’s judgemental look, she whined it was not that she’d been planning it, it’d just happened, and took the first sip. Wu sat down, wetted his lips with beer, pushed the glass away and tossed a rhetorical question into the dusky room,</p>
<p>‘How many times can you get into the same shit?’</p>
<p>‘Look who’s talking,’ she replied sulkily, moved closer to the armrest, as far as she could get away from Wu, whose face, in turn, twitched in a grimace, as if he had a retort on the tip of his tongue, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and inhaled the smoke. Weronika kept texting for a while until she sighed, put the phone down and suggested that maybe at least the two of them should stop arguing about it. Anyway, she’s sure that before two weeks have passed, in this series of break-ups and make-ups Jerzy and she will end up where they had started. He gave a conciliatory smile, kissed her on the temple and wrapped his arm around her shoulder only to withdraw it a moment later.</p>
<p>They sat for a while, saying nothing, against the background of the wall painted in stripes of different shades of green, with black-and-white artworks above their heads. Weronika smoked as well, pulled up her legs, and they stayed like that almost motionless for a good few minutes, staring into the void and releasing from their lungs occasional clouds of grey smoke. Finally, the thick curtain over the doorway opened, letting inside — in the company of a cold waft from the street — a woman of around forty.</p>
<p>‘Olka!’ On seeing her, Weronika let out a shriek, jumped to her feet and ran towards the door to throw herself into the woman’s arms.</p>
<p>The forty-year-old found the time to say hello to some friend at one of the tables before she headed deeper into this colourful, half-greenish, half-reddish tunnel, which was indeed formed by the interior of Kisielice, and went to the bar.</p>
<p>She came back to the table holding three beers, put them in front of her friends, then laughed, ran her hand through her dyed blond curls, tucked a tuft behind her ear, smoked and sat down. Having taken off her warm white jacket, she hung it on the back of the chair and — visibly amused for all this time — said that this thing with the attack was some deep shit, that there might be more at any moment.</p>
<p>‘Stop it. I’m fed up with discussing this topic over and over.’</p>
<p>‘But the problem won’t go away just because we pretend it doesn’t exist. It’s hard not to speak about it when such a, well, bomb hasn’t happened in years. We thought we were living in boring times of peace, and there you have it.’</p>
<p>Weronika replied she had two days off in a row for the first time since who knows when and was really sick of hearing about it. Olka’d better bollock her for getting back with Jerzy.</p>
<p>‘You’ve got back with Jerzy?’ Olka let out an honest, booming laugh, which infected the others a moment later. Then she changed the topic and asked Wu about the progress of his work on those washing machine instructions for use.</p>
<p>Thankfully he’s done with it. Now he’s getting down to writing a truly fascinating spreadsheet user manual. Maybe he’ll finally learn how to use a spreadsheet. He rubbed his eyebrow with his thumb again, sighed and said freelancing has surprisingly little to do with freedom. At the moment, his life is reduced to typing the shit out of the keyboard. This is not what he imagined a few years ago.</p>
<p>‘Oh, stop grumbling. You’d rather work in a shop?’</p>
<p>Weronika laughed. ‘It’s easy to say if you’re a director of a thriving company. Have you even been to the office this month?’</p>
<p>‘Don’t exaggerate. I sometimes drop by. Anyway, I’ve worked hard for that. If you don’t like it, you should find a busier friend, but I’m curious who’s going to pay for all those drinks then. Better tell me about that novel of yours.’</p>
<p>Wu told her to forget it, said he hadn’t had time lately and, frankly, no longer liked what he’d written so far. It seems he’ll have to begin from scratch if he only finds some free time. He patted his thigh twice with his open hand.</p>
<p>Weronika remarked with a sneer he would’ve had more free time if he hadn’t wandered from pub to pub every night, which Wu answered with a humorous ‘spierdalaj’ only to put out the cigarette and announce he needed to take a leak.</p>
<p>Once he disappeared behind the curtain, Weronika started talking about how insanely wasted she’d got the night before, totally blotto; she didn’t remember much: the voices of drunken people, the smell of kebabs, the bright car lights, the piercing frost. She’d met some guy — in Dragon, or earlier, in Kisielice — and the two of them walked somewhere across the market square towards Garbary Street, maybe to Mięsna cos where else could they’ve gone. When she woke up, she couldn’t remember anything else, except for the image of small glowing pink rectangles she still has before her eyes. She’s got no idea what to connect it with.</p>
<p>‘Brilliant!’ Olka laughed and added Weronika must take better care of herself, after which she took out a rustling fifty-zloty note and handed it to Wu, who’d just come back from the toilet, asking him to buy another round.</p>
