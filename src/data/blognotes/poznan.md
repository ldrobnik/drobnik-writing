When I think of my last winter in Poznań, I think of a meme from that time. It was a photo of a pavement with an inscription, ‘Remember? This is what a pavement looks like’.

Winter 2009/2010 was one of the longest and harshest winters I lived through. Pavements disappeared under a crust of frozen snow and sand. People popped into shops and pretended to be looking around only to hide from the freezing weather. Pubs filled with dense, toxic clouds of cigarette smoke. (It was the last winter before they banned smoking in public places.) The smell of fumes and kebabs lingered in the air as it always does, irrespective of the weather.

Can’t say which of those are my real memories and which have been filtered through the years of writing [VOSTOK](https://www.vraeydamedia.ca/shop/x55ht1b0h70i3bwv9qismih2f6b5nk), my genre-bending literary sci-fi.

I started working on the book in late 2009 and set it in Poznań during that long winter — unaware of the fact it will be my way of saying farewell to the city. In spring my wanderlust kicked in, and I moved to Kraków where I’ve lived ever since.

## A handful of facts

Poznań, the fifth largest Polish city, has a population similar to that of Edinburgh, but the entire agglomeration is more than twice this size.

## A roomful of feelings



Funnily enough, I could write about Poznań only from afar. Before I moved out, I wrote a few dozen pages but decided to scrap them. Only in the middle of a hot summer, in the centre of historic Kraków was I able to switch my Joyce-on-an-exile-writing-about-Dublin mode and start a book about a winter in a city that was no more.
