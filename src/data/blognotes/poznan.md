When I think of my last winter in Poznań, a meme from that time comes to my mind. It was a photo of a pavement with an inscription, ‘Remember? This is what a pavement looks like’.

Winter 2009/2010 was one of the longest and harshest winters I have lived through. Pavements disappeared under the crust of frozen snow and sand. People popped into shops and pretended to be looking around only to hide from the freezing weather. Pubs filled with dense, toxic clouds of cigarette smoke. (It was the last winter before they banned smoking in public places.) The smell of fumes and kebabs lingered in the air as it always does, irrespective of the weather.

Can’t say which of those are my real memories and which have been filtered through the years of writing [VOSTOK](https://www.vraeydamedia.ca/shop/x55ht1b0h70i3bwv9qismih2f6b5nk), my genre-bending literary sci-fi.

I started working on the book in late 2009 and set it in Poznań during that seemingly never-ending winter — unaware of the fact it will be my way of saying farewell to the city. In spring, my wanderlust kicked in, and I moved to Kraków where I’ve lived ever since.



## A handful of facts

Poznań, the fifth largest Polish city, has a population similar to that of Edinburgh, but the entire agglomeration is more than twice this size. The city is the capital of a region called Greater Poland (in Polish, Wielkopolska).

Some trivia:

- Poznań is among the oldest Polish cities. A place where Mieszko I, the first known ruler of Poland, would often hang around.
- It is located on the river Warta, the main tributary of the Oder.
- In addition to bridges spanning the Warta, Poznań has three bridges stretched over the torrent of railway tracks: Most Teatralny (Theatre Bridge), Most Uniwersytecki (University Bridge), and Most Dworcowy (Station Bridge).
- Poznań is the only city mentioned in Poland’s national anthem.
- The city is divided into five districts: Jeżyce, Grunwald, Wilda, Nowe Miasto, and Stare Miasto. The latter, although literally called the Old Town, accommodates not only the historic centre but also the landscapes of blocks of flats in the north.
- No one really uses the five administrative districts in everyday conversations. People usually refer to themselves as coming from smaller neighbourhoods, such as Łazarz, Sołacz, or Winogrady.
- There’s no underground but the city has a fast tram line connecting the north with the centre. The line is called Poznań Fast Tram (Poznański Szybki Tramwaj). The acronym PST gave rise to affectionate monicker *pestka*. It literally means ‘seed’ but also has an idiomatic meaning similar to English ‘piece of cake’.
- Confusingly to outsiders, Poznań dwellers often use the word *tej* for emphasis.

## A roomful of feelings

I moved to Poznań as a nineteen year old for university. Nostalgic for the smaller, cosier Kalisz where I attended secondary school, I needed years to feel at ease in this larger, louder, hostile city.

In time, I grew to like the city’s qualities that I at first found overwhelming. The vast spaces, broad roads,  tram wires stretching above your head, monumental buildings, seas of blocks of flats.

The city watched me find my way around adult life: making and losing friends, finding love in all the wrong places, figuring out what I’m made of, what I’m really about. 

I remember a moment when I felt in Poznań completely at home, as if I was born there. I was walking the uneven pavement in Chwaliszewo Street where I lived, headed for a night out in my favourite pub Dragon, and Poznań around me fitted me like a glove. It was both a pleasant and a suffocating feeling. One that made me realise I wanted something different, something more.

Funnily enough, I could write about Poznań only from afar. Before I moved out, I wrote a few dozen pages of *Vostok* but decided to scrap them. Only in the middle of a hot summer, in the centre of historic Kraków was I able to switch my *Joyce-on-an-exile-writing-about-Dublin* mode and start a book about a winter in a city that was no more.
