A tram number 9 derailed in the district of Wilda, hitting cars.

Meanwhile, in a completely different part of the city, along the PST (Poznań Fast Tram) line, on tracks laid down in a long deep trench, which — full of snow — formed a completely white tunnel, a two-cabin tram number 16 hurtled along like a bullet. People were crowding inside, the cabins fishtailed at sharper turns, and each time it happened, a sudden wave came through the passengers clinging to yellow tubes and the backs of seats, from the front to the end of each cabin, making them for a moment like one organism.

At the end of the second cabin, leaning against railings and staring outside a dirty pane, stood Weronika (in a red jacket) and some other woman, probably a bit younger: wearing a black coat, black boots, thick vivid orange tights, wrapped in a black scarf onto which her straight dark brown hair was falling. She tucked a tuft of it behind her ear. Weronika and the girl didn’t talk, the deafening clatter of the wheels on the rails being a possible reason, and glanced at each other only now and then, for the most part staring absent-mindedly at tracks flashing outside the window. The view behind the panes made up the following sequence: the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Słowiańska Street Station), the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Solidarity Avenue Station), and then the whiteness of snow again.

The oblong barrack of a shopping centre loomed over the tunnel, its elevation illuminated with glaring lights, a luminous yellow cord undulating along the building, and from the perspective of the rushing tram, this edifice could resemble a dignified, slowly swimming whale. When the vehicle reached the next, this time stunningly colourful, station (Lechicka/Poznań Plaza), Weronika told Zuza (that is how she addressed the girl gazing outside the window) to wake up, they needed to get off, and then they both headed for the exit.

 

No more than two hours later, another tram number 16 arrived at a stop in Little Garbary Street, the automatic doors opened, and people started to step out of the green cabins. Among them were Weronika and Zuza, carrying heavy linen bags clanking with bottles of wine.

‘Oh, give me a break.’ Weronika looked away. Zuza touched her shoulder in a conciliatory gesture and said she was worried about her, that’s all.

‘Yeah, yeah, everyone’s worried about me, but at the same time they treat me like I’m twelve.’

‘Because you behave like you’re fucking twelve.’ Zuza laughed, and Weronika quickly joined her in laughter.

Zuza added, all right, she’ll stop wittering about Jerzy cos it didn’t make much sense anyway, and Weronika was going to do what she always, kurwa, did, after which she cursed the never-ending frost and suggested they go here, to the green, leave their bags on the bench and smoke cos another few minutes without a cig and she’ll go nuts.

Weronika uttered a long sigh. She gets it, she knows what she’s doing is totally dumb and nothing good’s going to come of it, but there’s something about Jerzy that she can’t free herself of. Anyhow, maybe they should change the topic, and a smoke is a great idea.

They left their bags on a dilapidated bench, Zuza took out a pack of cigarettes, offered one to her friend, they started to smoke. There was a row of cars standing in the street, a tram crossing the junction, while the snow around them covered a layer of dead grass, animal faeces, litter, shards. The cigarette smoke was milky from the frost.

‘Did you see the coverage? I mean of the attack,’ said Zuza. ‘You have to admit it was a spectacular job. The damage was, kurwa, massive, and it’ll take fucking years to patch up the rifts in the infrastructure.’

She paused when she saw someone: along the untended path crossing the green walked a fairly tall blond man in an olive jacket with a white cap pulled over his ears. On seeing the girls, he gave a wide grin and approached them.

They talked for a while, the man decided to have a smoke as well, Weronika and Zuza called him Kuba, Kuba asked whether they were going to Mięsna that night, to which they replied they were throwing a small party at Wu’s, but Kuba should drop by if he was in the neighbourhood anyway. There’ll be the usual bunch, there’ll be squid, and the ratio of bottles of wine to participants looks quite promising.

Kuba replied he’d think about it cos he was working on some ‘friend’, as he called her, but he can just as well work on her at Wu’s, after which he said he must be going cos it was his tram, but he’ll let them know.

The girls finished off their cigarettes, put them out against the edge of the bench, lifted their bags heavy with wine, bread, vegetables, cephalopods, headed towards a zebra crossing and — after several minutes at a red light — kept going along Estkowski Street for a bit. They carefully walked down an ice-covered escarpment to where the Warta River once flowed but now it was a sports field and a row of parking spaces, crossed this field, carried on among cars parked in the snow, went past a row of tin garages (black-and-white graffiti on the walls) and walked further, towards Chwaliszewo Street.

<br/>

The kitchen walls were covered with ragged dark pink wallpaper; on the shabby kitchen cabinets, on the kitchen worktop, on the fridge stood flowerpots spewing out tangled ivy shoots. Once you entered the kitchen, you had the impression it was a freeze-frame from a film, and one careless move would suffice for the whole room to be consumed, in a split second, by the vividly green vegetation.

Weronika and Zuza sat at the table covered with plastic cloth and crammed with bottles of wine, a bowl full of (deep-fried) squid in beer batter, a plate of lemons, an ashtray. Wu stood opposite them, leaning against the kitchen worktop and tapping his leg along to music coming from a laptop placed on top of the fridge.

The three of them drank red wine, cigarette ends lit up above the table. Weronika said she dreamt about small glowing pink rectangles, the same she saw that drunken night. She laughed, said she must have taken some shit while under the influence, or that chap, whoever he was, slipped a date rape drug into her cocktail, as Kuba generously suggested. Speaking of Kuba, where is he? They should call him to come by.

Wu sighed and started chastening Weronika, saying she needed to take care of herself cos she was really going over the top this time and it couldn’t fucking end well, when loud ringing of the door phone interrupted him.

Wu disappeared into the entrance hall, a cold draught from the staircase entered the kitchen, one could hear — in spite of the blaring music — increasingly loud steps on the stairs, and a moment later Olka came in, uttering a cheerful ‘cześć’ and followed by Wu carrying an armful of wine bottles.

She forced her way through the grey smoke to kiss Weronika and Zuza, declared she came only for a minute cos she needed to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, but she’d love to taste the legendary squid. Then she took a cigarette in her hand and began to look for a lighter. Weronika lifted a burning match in front of Olka’s face. Kuba was supposed to be here, but he’s working on some chick, so it’s anyone’s guess if he’s going to come.

Yeah, Olka knows, she saw them yesterday in Dragon. She reached into the bowl for a piece of squid flesh coated in breadcrumbs, devoured it in one go and went on to say this girl was a tough one. For the whole evening Kuba pretended to be interested in pharmacy, as she was some pharmacy student, whispered in her ear he’d love to see her in a lab coat and protective eyewear, he almost started naming his favourite over-the-counter drugs when the girl interrupted him mid-sentence, saying it’s been lovely, but she must be home by midnight. She even tricked him into paying for the cab.

Wu, flipping through songs on the computer, said Kuba never liked the easy way. To Zuza’s remark expressing her irritation with the constant change of music, he replied with unvarying composure he was looking for a piece he listened to while wasted the night before. He totally can’t remember which one it was. Or maybe he’s imagining things.

Finally, he gave up, played a random track, leant against the wall and said those terrorists were fucked up big time. Watching their speech sent shivers down his spine. Though maybe we shouldn’t be surprised: the authorities treated them like cattle for centuries, and when you look at this now, it’s hard to believe we were so naïve. This was bound to happen eventually. But there must’ve been a lot of bluff in all this; it’s impossible they have the technology they were talking about.

Could Weronika, please, relax with a glass of wine on her day off without being forced to hearing about those fuckers all the time? (For a while, she squatted on a leatherette chair with her glass, giving an occasional eye roll.)

‘You’re fucking lucky you’ve got a day off,’ retorted Zuza, who — as she quickly added — didn’t have a day off in three weeks because her greed made her take on another translation, though her schedule was already full, and to top this all off, Weronika was dragging her round the shops and talked her into cooking some, kurwa, squid, as if she knew how to cook.

‘Oh, have a drink.’ Weronika laughed, filling up Zuza’s glass.

<br/>

The events of the rest of this evening could be captured in stills: Wu leaning against the fridge, Zuza, Weronika and Olka at the table, bright dots of burning tobacco. Next, a similar scene, but with Kuba and a dainty bright-haired girl standing in the doorway, the girl was pale and had big blue eyes, she barely spoke a word. Then the dark pink kitchen, Weronika and Zuza above an empty bowl, the former whining about her complicated relationship with Jerzy, a cloud of grey smoke above their heads. Half an hour later at the table sat Weronika, Zuza and Kuba, the latter walked his blonde friend to a cab and told the girls someone must’ve got pretty stoned cos they broke into the military museum and stole a war scythe. Even later, a similar scene: Wu standing in the doorway with a bottle of wine, saying Olka went to Dragon after all but promised she’d be back, which meant she wouldn’t. Then a bulb blowing out, darkness instantly filling the kitchen. Later again, the rest of them sitting by candlelight, against the background of the wallpaper which seemed almost black in this light, Weronika immersed in a greenish glow beaming from the phone and texting. After one more hour, there was only Wu, Kuba and Zuza, the latter saying it always ends like this, sooner or later Jerzy calls and after ten minutes Weronika’s gone. And the last scene: a candle burning out, Wu and Kuba sitting in silence above the last of the wine, with lustreless eyes, smoking; the room was tightly filled with smoke, the smoke was as dense as fog.

<br/>

A heavy dark sky hung above the city, it was night, Poznań’s blocks of flats and tenement houses remained dormant, car parks choked on freezing air, lampposts cast a lurid light, snow lay heavy on the roofs, and a strong, piercing wind ran along the network of streets; it carried frost.

In light from the street you could see unfocused outlines of the furniture and cardboard boxes, crumpled bedding, Wu tossing and turning. You could smell the pungent scent of tobacco smoke. Hear the muffled voices of brawling chavs. Finally, Wu sighed, got up from the bed, walked through the darkness of the entrance hall to the darkness of the kitchen, groped for the switch, pushed it, and when in spite of this it remained dark, he silently cursed the blown-out bulb. He felt around the worktop to find a bottle of mineral water and started to drink — with fast, greedy gulps.

Twenty minutes later he already walked along Garbary Street, there was no one within the range of his sight, some dead-drunk girl lay in one of the doorways, but he couldn’t possibly see it, so he walked, trembling with cold, towards Bernardine Square, passed a shop selling telescopes (a bloated Jupiter on a poster next to the entrance), a row of black shop windows, a chemist’s ‘Wenus’, a dot-matrix display scrolling the message, ‘Stay healthy. Stay productive. Collect points.’

Then he followed the tramline towards the river, Mostowa Street at this time of night was dark and motionless, no cars were approaching, so Wu walked diagonally to the other side and kept striding along the street, only to take a turn before Roch Bridge and go down a steep embankment to the river itself. The Warta was ice-bound and covered with a thick layer of snow, the sky whitish from the city glow. Wu smoked, slowly carrying along the invisible bank, and as he walked, he sometimes squinted and massaged his eyelids, like one does to soothe an unbearable headache.

One time after he opened his eyes, and it was when he nearly reached Chrobry Bridge, he stopped to stare, straining his eyes, into the dark space under the bridge’s deck. Right next to the bank, under a pillar, loomed a shape. Wu hesitated, then took a few steps forward, approaching the shape to a distance at which one could already see it was a girl kneeling in an unnatural pose, strangely bent forwards.

He asked if everything was all right. Silence.

After a moment he came closer, an arm’s length away, and — with hesitation — gently touched her shoulder, but the girl didn’t budge. Finally, he took his phone out from his pocket and shone it on her face.

The reddish light revealed a mouth gagged with a decent-sized lemon, blue, ghastly open eyes, hands tied behind the back and a belly slit open to pour onto the snow a ripe cluster of guts.
