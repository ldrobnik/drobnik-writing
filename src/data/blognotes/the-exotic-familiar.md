When I think of my last winter in Poznań, a meme from that time comes to my mind. It was a photo of a pavement with an inscription, ‘Remember? This is what a pavement looks like’.

Winter 2009–2010 was one of the longest and harshest I remember. Pavements disappeared under the crust of frozen snow and sand. People popped into random shops to hide from the freezing weather. Pubs filled with dense, toxic clouds of cigarette smoke. (It was the last winter before they banned smoking in public places.) The smell of fumes and kebabs lingered in the air as it always does, irrespective of the weather.

Can’t say which of the above are my real memories and which have been filtered through the years of writing [VOSTOK](https://www.vraeydamedia.ca/shop/x55ht1b0h70i3bwv9qismih2f6b5nk), my genre-bending literary sci-fi.

I started working on the book in Poznań at the beginning of that prolonged winter and chose the frigid city as its setting. Little did I know it would be my farewell letter. In spring, my wanderlust kicked in, and I finally moved to Kraków where I’ve lived ever since.

## A handful of facts

Poznań is the capital of a region called Wielkopolska (Greater Poland). It’s the fifth largest Polish city with a population similar to that of Edinburgh.

Some trivia:

- Poznań is among the oldest Polish cities. A place where Mieszko&nbsp;I, the first known ruler of Poland, would often hang around.
- It is located on the river Warta, the main tributary of the Oder.
- In addition to bridges spanning the Warta, Poznań has three bridges stretched over the torrent of railway tracks. Each is named after a landmark in its proximity: the opera theatre, the university, the railway station.
- Poznań is the only city mentioned in Poland’s national anthem.
- It is divided into five districts: Jeżyce, Grunwald, Wilda, Nowe Miasto, and Stare Miasto. The last one, although literally called the Old Town, accommodates not only the historic centre but also the landscapes of blocks of flats in the north.
- No one really uses the five administrative districts in everyday conversations. People usually refer to smaller neighbourhoods, such as Łazarz, Sołacz, or Winogrady.
- There’s no subway, but the city has a fast tram line connecting the north with the centre, called Poznań Fast Tram (Poznański Szybki Tramwaj). The acronym PST gave rise to an affectionate monicker *pestka*. It literally means ‘seed’ but also has an idiomatic sense similar to English ‘piece of cake’.
- Confusingly to outsiders, Poznań dwellers often use a meaningless word *tej* for emphasis.

## A roomful of feelings

I moved to Poznań for university. Nostalgic for the smaller, cosier Kalisz where I attended secondary school, I needed years to feel at ease in this larger, louder, more hostile city.

In time, I grew to enjoy the city’s qualities I initially found overwhelming. The vast spaces, broad roads, tram wires stretching above my head, monumental buildings, seas of blocks of flats.

The city watched me clumsily find my way around adult life: make and lose friends, find love in all the wrong places, try to figure out what I’m made of, what I’m really about. 

I remember a moment when I felt in Poznań completely at home. I was walking the uneven pavement of Chwaliszewo Street where I lived, headed for a night out in my favourite pub Dragon—Poznań around me fitted me like a glove. It was a warm and at the same time suffocating feeling. One that made me realise I wanted something different, something more.

## A trip to the uncanny valley

There must be a compound German word for this feeling of knowing something so well it makes you feel uneasy. Whatever we call it, it was possibly part of the reason why I chose a place so familiar for the setting of a science-fiction novel.

There’s definitely a Russian word for presenting, in a work of art, the familiar in an unfamiliar way so the audience can see it from a new perspective. The word is *ostranenie* (остранение), translated into English as defamiliarisation.

The term was coined in 1917 by Viktor Shklovsky, one of the main figures of Russian formalism, and originally meant to distinguish the language of poetry from that of prose. Nowadays, we use it in a wider sense. As Shklovsky puts it:

> The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar’, to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.

Believe it or not, there’s a whole journal dedicated to defamiliarised writing called [The Gravity of the Thing](http://thegravityofthething.com/), which I highly recommend. It was this magazine that made realise I use defamiliarisation in my own writing (I even ended up publishing [a story](http://thegravityofthething.com/devonian-lukasz-drobnik/) there).

I won’t spoil the nature of the sci-fi element in VOSTOK (hope you’ll want to discover it on your own), but the presence of a speculative layer results in an interesting shift: from the realistic contemporary Poznań into an otherwordly realm. A shift that invites the reader to look at seemingly ordinary things from an unexpected angle.

## The nostalgia factor

Funnily enough, I could write about Poznań only from afar. Before I moved out, I wrote a few dozen pages of VOSTOK but decided to scrap them.

It took a move across the country to get things going. In the middle of a hot summer, I settled in Kazimierz, Kraków’s historic Jewish neighbourhood, a place that felt exotic and vibrant compared to the restrained, predictable Poznań.

And as much as I was excited about my new chapter of life, I dearly missed Poznań: the people, the places, the atmosphere. Back then, Google Street View didn’t cover Polish cities. This meant I couldn’t virtually stroll its streets on my laptop screen and had to rely on my memory and whatever I could find online.

The change of place did the trick. It gave me just enough nostalgia and distance to switch to my best *Joyce-on-an-exile* mode and start a book about a winter in a city that was no more.
