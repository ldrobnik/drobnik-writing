Polish alexandrine is the iambic pentameter of Polish literature. Among us pierogi-eaters it is known as *trzynastozgłowiec*, which simply means ‘thirteen-syllable verse’.

To help you understand how hyper-Polish this metric line is, let me just say that Adam Mickiewicz chose it for *Pan Tadeusz*, Poland’s national epic.

[VOSTOK](https://www.vraeydamedia.ca/shop/x55ht1b0h70i3bwv9qismih2f6b5nk), my genre-bending literary sci-fi, is probably the most Polish book I’ll ever write. It made sense then to interweave the text with a *trzynastozgłowiec* poem. One that is a queer retelling of Bradbury’s “The Long Rain” because who’s going to stop me.



> The cruel rains of Venus, we are walking slowly,  
> lifting our feet with effort through the pallid jungle  
> that opens up a ghastly mouth before our faces,  
> trying hard to stop thinking of the never-ending  
> beating down of fat raindrops against our pale bodies,  
> trying hard to keep breathing and not choke on water,  
> plants as if from a horror, eyelids as if leaden.

## Anatomy of the beast

In each verse, the thirteen syllables of Polish alexandrine are grouped into two phrases. The first one contains seven syllables, the second six, and they’re separated by a caesura. The penultimate syllable of each phrase is stressed.

Perhaps it’s the last rule that makes *trzynastozgłoskowiec* sound so naturally, effortlessly Polish. In the vast majority of Polish words, the stress falls on the penultimate syllable, so it’s fairly easy to say even the most banal thought in Polish alexandrine:

> Choć jestem polskim chłopcem, nie lubię kiełbasy.
>
> *(Though I’m a Polish boy, I don’t like kiełbasa.)*

And even the most banal thought said in *trzynastozgłoskowiec* has this soothing, lulling cadence. One that made it difficult for me to stay awake during the compulsory reading of *Pan Tadeusz* in primary school.

## Translator’s dilemma

I wrote the first draft of VOSTOK in Polish. It was only many drafts and rejections later that I decided to undertake the humongous task of translating the novel into English. (Spoiler alert: it did pay off.)



## Pushing the English into the Polish mould

And so the Polish verse:

> Idziemy wciąż przed siebie, deszcz pada bez przerwy,  
> mimowolnie poruszam ustami jak ryba,  
> podnoszę ciężkie nogi, zmęczone powieki  
> i nie ma nic prócz deszczu, nie ma nic prócz smutku.

became the English verse:

> We keep progressing deeper, the rain is unceasing,  
> mouth opening and closing in a fish-like fashion,  
> limp legs are as if wooden, eyelids as if leaden,  
> there’s nothing left but downpour, nothing left but sadness.

## Bending the form

The cadence of Polish alexandrine is so soothing and predictable that any deviation from it jolts you out of your relaxed state and makes you pay attention.

I used this effect in the Polish drafts of VOSTOK, so it made sense to replicate it in the English version:

> Stream after stream after stream we follow the shoreline,  
> the mouths of brooks and rivers, sometimes so expansive  
> that our boat cannot pass them, and we go back deeper  
> into the jungle coloured like milk, glitter, buildings.
>
> VOSTOK by Łukasz Drobnik

Note that even though the phrase “stream after stream after stream” has the required seven syllables, the stress falls on its last syllable rather than penultimate.
