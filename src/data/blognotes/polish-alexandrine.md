Polish alexandrine is the iambic pentameter of Polish literature. Among us pierogi-eaters it is known as *trzynastozgłowiec*, which simply means ‘thirteen-syllable verse’.

To help you understand the importance of this form, know that Adam Mickiewicz used Polish alexandrine for *Pan Tadeusz*, Poland’s national epic.

[VOSTOK](https://www.vraeydamedia.ca/shop/x55ht1b0h70i3bwv9qismih2f6b5nk), my genre-bending literary sci-fi, is probably the most Polish book I’ll ever write, so it made sense to interweave the text with a *trzynastozgłowiec* poem. One that is a queer retelling of  Bradbury’s “The Long Rain”.

## Anatomy of the beast



> The cruel rains of Venus, we are walking slowly,  
> lifting our feet with effort through the pallid jungle  
> that opens up a ghastly mouth before our faces,  
> trying hard to stop thinking of the never-ending  
> beating down of fat raindrops against our pale bodies,  
> trying hard to keep breathing and not choke on water,  
> plants as if from a horror, eyelids as if leaden.

## Translator’s dilemma

I wrote the earliest draft of VOSTOK in Polish.

> We keep progressing deeper, the rain is unceasing,  
> mouth opening and closing in a fish-like fashion,  
> limp legs are as if wooden, eyelids as if leaden,  
> there’s nothing left but downpour, nothing left but sadness.

## Bending the form

> Stream after stream after stream we follow the shoreline,  
> the mouths of brooks and rivers, sometimes so expansive  
> that our boat cannot pass them, and we go back deeper  
> into the jungle coloured like milk, glitter, buildings.
